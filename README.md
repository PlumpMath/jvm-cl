# jvm-cl

Simple custom ClassLoader project illustrating how to swap class definition in runtime using JAR file downloaded from the remote server.

Unfortunately application throws SecurityException on class load attempt.

Need more knowledge to proceed with this matter.

## running the project

`mvn compile exec:java`
